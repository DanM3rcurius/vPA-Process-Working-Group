# How to engage & contribute
## On boarding & getting stripes 
- Jump in the [CATALYST UNITED DISCORD](https://discord.gg/7EsA33kk)
- Head over to the [role-selection-channel](https://discord.com/channels/946921942143885342/949733050932154398/962051332896874577) 
- select **Project Catalyst WG** by clicking the :hook: emoji below the message. 

This will enable You to view in the Veteran Proposal Assesor Working Group. 
You're welcome to choose any other additional roles that interest you.



### Information Overload?
For better oversight it is possible to collapse the categories. Only channels with unread messages will stay visible (bold & white) when a category is collapsed.

General discussions around the Veteran PA Working Group can be found in the [PC-WG forum](https://discord.gg/aaGYhV36) 


### Last and most important step!
Familiarise deeply with & the [Code of Conduct](https://pa-vpa-operations-treasury.gitbook.io/vpa-process-working-group/on-boarding-welcome/code-of-conduct#for-the-current-code-of-conduct-coc-please-see-chapter-8.1-in-the-governance-framework-for-pa-v-pa-o) & the [Working Group flow](https://pa-vpa-operations-treasury.gitbook.io/vpa-process-working-group/on-boarding-welcome/current-vpa-process-wg-flow).


## Start contributing
After you are familiar with the **Code of Conduct (CoC**) and the **Working Group flow** you can join the DeWork board [via this link](ttps://app.dework.xyz/catalyst-circle-ca-r/veteran-ca-wg)and start writing suggestions and/or claiming bounties.

Here's an example of a DeWork task (bounty) opened in Discord

## Ask (& find guidance)
In case of uncertainty or a feeling of being lost, you can reach out to moderators or other veteran PAs in the Discord and please ask away. 
Your inquiries will help to make the on-boarding process more meaningful and engaging!
