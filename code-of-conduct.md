### Code of Conduct (CoC) as a _Living Document_

To further develop the Code of Conduct within the context of the vPA process it was proposed to do the following:

> Using a Pol.is survey to gather what statements should be added to the Code of Conduct of the Veteran PA Working Group. \
> Those statements will be used to fashion rules from in an ad hoc fashion.&#x20;
>
> **Ad hoc fashion?** If a Statement in the CoC is being ignored, then from that case a rule could be extrapolated. In case a rule hasn't been broken for a long time, it might is superfluous and can be deleted; the statement remains for another incident to pop up and create a new rule that might fit better for that timespace context. This helps with keeping the CoC lean.
