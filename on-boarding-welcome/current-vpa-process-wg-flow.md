# Current vPA Process WG flow



## Status Quo Bounty Flow&#x20;

**Anyone** from the QA community **can create a bounty request**. \
To discuss and drive the bounty one has to be a member of [Catalyst United Discord](https://discord.gg/x253q8r2).

Bounty manager can be anyone that understands and is able to facilitate the process.&#x20;

_We're currently iterating on the Bounty Manager status, any feedback and input is much appreciated:_

<details>

<summary>Bounty Manager status </summary>

In case a bounty doesn't move or is not commented on for longer than 72h, a new bounty manager may pick it up. Upon passing a stage 12h can be added to the reaction timer. Bounty reward is only received by the bounty manager that approves work (it's up to the manager to decide if he wants to split it with previous involved ones). \
This should incentivise bounty managers to facilitate in a timely manner and focus on only one or two bounties a time.&#x20;

### What else is there?

There's an alternative option, to be revisited in case of bottlenecks developing due to high amount of bounty submissions.
